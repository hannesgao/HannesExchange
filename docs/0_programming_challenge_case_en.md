# Programming Challenge Case - AMM
Development of an Advanced, Secure, and Gas-Optimized AMM Platform

## 0x0 Objective
Create a robust, upgradeable smart contract platform that allows users to swap between ETH and multiple ERC20 tokens using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. The platform will implement advanced security features, optimize for gas efficiency, and ensure seamless upgradeability. Comprehensive testing, deployment strategies, and documentation will be provided.


## 0x1 Technical Requirements

### 1. Smart Contract Development

#### 1.1 AMM Implementation
  - Develop an AMM that supports swapping between ETH and at least two ERC20 tokens.
  - Implement liquidity pools, allowing users to add/remove liquidity and earn fees.
  - **(Optional)** Include slippage control mechanisms and dynamic pricing based on pool reserves.

#### 1.2 Advanced Access Control
  - Use role-based access control to manage different permissions within the contract.
  - **(Optional)** Implement multi-signature requirements for critical functions.

---

### 2. Security Features

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Mitigation
  - Identify and protect against common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow, denial of service, and access control issues.

#### 2.2 Emergency Measures
  - Implement a circuit breaker or emergency stop function that can halt operations in case of detected anomalies.

#### 2.3 Audit-Ready Code
  - **(Optional)** Write code that is structured and commented to facilitate third-party audits.

---

### 3. Upgradeability and Data Migration

#### 3.1 Complex Upgrades
  - Demonstrate upgrading the contract with changes in the storage structure, ensuring data integrity.
  - Provide migration scripts and procedures.

#### 3.2 Eternal Storage Pattern
  - **(Optional)** Utilize the Eternal Storage pattern to manage state separately from logic.

---

### 4. Gas Optimization

#### 4.1 Efficient Coding Practices
  - Optimize functions for minimal gas consumption, explaining the techniques used.
  - Use events judiciously to balance between necessary logging and gas costs.

---

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### 5.1 Comprehensive Test Suite
  - Write extensive tests covering all functionalities, including unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests.

#### 5.2 Security Analysis
  - **(Optional)** Use static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.

---

### 6. Multi-Environment Deployment

#### 6.1 Deployment Scripts & Instructions

- Provide scripts and instructions for deploying to different environments.

---

### 7. Documentation

#### 7.1 Detailed & Comprehensive Documentations

- Include an architectural overview, detailed design rationale, and comprehensive user and developer guides.
